# Demo App to Display NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day
This is a React JS learning project based on a tutorial by developer, Kapehe at 
[https://scotch.io/tutorials/make-a-stellar-react-nasa-app-in-10-minutes](https://scotch.io/tutorials/make-a-stellar-react-nasa-app-in-10-minutes).

I worked through the tutorial to get some practice with router and Hooks. 

Made some small customizations: 
- Added a MorphBall component, which shows a shrinking and growing circle while waiting for the image from the API. I got some practice with the styled-component package to help implement the CSS animations.

The running app is hosted at [https://demoapod.herokuapp.com/](https://demoapod.herokuapp.com/)
